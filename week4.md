During week 4, my group still practiced more python and practiced cleaning more data. I met our new group member, Heather, who is a high 
shcool tecaher. On Tuesday, before we left for the holiday, our mentor gave us seperate assignments to get started on our mid progress 
presentation. Thursday there was a group trip to NASA it was informative and very interesting. I could see myself working there in the future
based on their good work schedule and friendly work environment.
