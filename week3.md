This week we gathered more articles to use in a literature review. We gathered 10 a piece and then read. We then used the data from the 
articles we read. Most of our data came from the Gene Expression Omnibus and the SBCB website. We imported the files into Google Colab and 
then, we praticed how to clean data, so that we won't have many questions when we start to process them by ourselves. And then used the data 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus website. to further clean it. Visitng the John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab was interesting and very though 
invoking. Just from the name of the lab I thought that it was just a physics lab. What interested me the most was the Neuroscience and Robot 
section of the presentation.
