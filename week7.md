This week my group and I did more data cleaning. I practiced for the presentation and did some small last minute tweaks. I presented at the
mid summer symposium on developing a machine learning model to predict lung cancer from genetic biomarker using transcriptomic datasets.
On Thursday, I started editing the methodology section of the paper. On Friday, I received some feedback on what could be moved around in
the research paper.
