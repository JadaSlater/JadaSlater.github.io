## About My Project

mBot Neo

Problem: There isn't a machine learning model that accurately detects the Genetic Biomarkers and Early Prediction of Lung Cancer. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following: 

- Develop a Machine Learning Model to detect Genetic Biomarkers and early prediction of Lung Cancer from Transcriptomic Datasets.
