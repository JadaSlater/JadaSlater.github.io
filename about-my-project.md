## About My Project

mBot Neo

Problem: There isn't a machine learning model that accurately detects the Genetic Biomarkers and Early Prediction of Lung Cancer from Transcriptomic Datasets, that take into count both types of Lung Cancer (SCLC and NSCLC). 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following: 

- Develop a Machine Learning Model to detect Genetic Biomarkers and early prediction of Lung Cancer from Transcriptomic Datasets.
