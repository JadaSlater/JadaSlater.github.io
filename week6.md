This week we put the finishing touches on the introduction for the research paper. My group finished the slides for the 
mid summer presentation. We also found more data sets and started the cleaing process of the data. So far my group has
found 400+ data samples. We were looking forward to presenting this week, we were prepared. The delay has given us chance to
prepare even more and find and clean extra datasets.
