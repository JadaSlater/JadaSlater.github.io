During Week 1, I met my group members, my mentor, and learned more about the project that I was going to be working on this summer. I also did some beginning classes in Python 101. The class was informative and easy to catch on to, being that I did have little to no knowledge about Python. The team building exercises were fun and helped me become closer to my lab partners, and get to know them better.
