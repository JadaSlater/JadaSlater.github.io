For the start of week 2, I met my graduate mentor. We first started off with picking apart our project name and defining it and knowing what it means. We then started going back over the basics of Python, looking over different machine learning models. I also met a new group member that was added. We started looking for data for our project and to format our literary review. I did some practice coding. Overall, this week consisted of doing background work, to further our knowledge and help us to not have so many questions when it came to starting our actual work.
