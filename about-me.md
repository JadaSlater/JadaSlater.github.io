## About Me
My name is Jada Slater. I am from Birmingham, Alabama. I am a rising Senior Biology major at Morgan State University, interested in 
Bioinformatics and Biotech. I am currently expected to graduate in Spring 2025. This is my first time having an experience in coding.
This is also, my first internship while being a college student. I plan to recieve my master's degree in Bioinoformatics after graduation. 
I was stuck between that and biotechnology, but my mentor, Dr. Roshan Paudel, has convinced me.
