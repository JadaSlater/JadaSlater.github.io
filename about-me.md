## About Me
My name is Jada Slater. I am from Birmingham, Alabama. I am a rising Senior Biology major for Fall 2024 at Morgan State University. 
I am also interested in Bioinformatics and Biotechnology. I am currently expected to graduate in Spring 2025. This is my first time having an 
experience in coding. This is also, my first internship while being a college student and I'm hoping to gain the necessary experience. I plan 
to recieve my master's degree in Bioinoformatics after graduation. I was stuck between that and biotechnology, but my mentor, Dr. Roshan 
Paudel, has convinced me to pursue bioinformatics.
