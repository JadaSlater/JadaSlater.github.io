This week was a very moderate week. The research has been cleaned and processed. The slides have been finised and edited since Monday.
We've practiced presenting since Tuesday. Feedback was recieved on the paper and corrections were made. We've turned everything in, so
no the group and I are just biding time until the presentation. I networked and added some people from different projects on LinkedIN. This
last week has been a little bittersweet because my team and I worked so well together and built and great relationship. Since everyone lives
in the Baltimore area or goes to Morgan, we'll still be able to keep in touch.
