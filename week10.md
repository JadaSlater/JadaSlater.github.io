This week on Monday, we just practiced again over the presentation, so that we could be prepared. Received feedback that our paper is most
likely to be published. On Tuesday, we presented and got good feedback on our presentation. We also took picture with each other.
Since wednesday is our last day, we're going to receive certificates of completion. I also, plan to network even more at the last event 
we have. This summer was very exciting and knowledgable. This was my first summer coding since I am a biology major. I'm interested in
biotech and bioinformatics, so this was very helpful and gave me the necessary experience.
